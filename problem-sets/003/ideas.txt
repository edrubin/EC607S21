Ideas

1. Classic, cross-sectional IV application (Michael's problem set?)

2. IV simulation
	- heterogeneous treatment effects
	- all groups have different mean effects (compliers, always takers, never takers)
	- two instruments affect different subgroups of the compliers (with differing shares)
	- estimate the LATE for each instrument and for the instruments jointly
	- what happens if defiers respond to a third, separate instrument (z3)
	- drop defiers from z3; add in defiers who respond to the second instrument (z2)

3. Measurement error and IV
	- classical
	- non-classical twist: LATE and heterogeneity 

4. Randomized encouragement design (Meredith's problem set?)

5. Bias of IV in finite samples with more instruments. (simulation?)
